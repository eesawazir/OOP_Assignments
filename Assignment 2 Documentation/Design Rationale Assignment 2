We couldn't assign rocketpart. We had to add 2 classes addRocketBody and
addRocketEngine to build the Rocket on the RocketPad. We just created an object 
for each parts and used them as items.

We added UnlockDoorAction to allow the player to be able to open a door.

We don't have to make a class for addplan because when you interact with Q, it
takes our plan and return the body.So when building the rocket too we don't have 
to give it a plan as having the body means we already had the plan as prerequisite.
